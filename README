Steel is a dynamically typed interpreted scripting language that I created originally for my RPG engine "Stone Ring". 
It has syntax familiar to C-style language programmers, and not too distant syntactically from languages like Javascript, php, and others of that ilk. 

Steel is a passion project. I know there are many other languages available that would have worked for adding scriptability to my game engine, but I wanted to create my own. It was a great learning experience. 

In the future I plan to add byte code to Steel and a byte code VM so that I can easily pause and resume execution.

It uses trison and reflex, successors to bison and flex created by my friend Victor Dods to generate the parser and scanner.
